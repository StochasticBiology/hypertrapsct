\usage{
plotHypercube.bubbles.compare(
  my.post.list,
  reorder = FALSE,
  transpose = FALSE,
  thetastep = 10,
  p.scale = 1,
  sqrt.trans = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{my.post.list}{A list of fitted models returned from HyperTraPS}

\item{reorder}{Whether to order features by mean acquisition; default FALSE}

\item{transpose}{Whether to transpose the plot; default FALSE}

\item{thetastep}{The number of discrete steps in a polygon approximating a circle segment; default 10 (higher gives smoother visuals but takes longer)}

\item{p.scale}{A scaling factor relating probability to bubble radius; default 1}

\item{sqrt.trans}{Whether to sqrt-transform the probabilities (giving more uniform bubble sizes); default FALSE}

\item{bins}{The number of bins to group time-ordering into; default 0 (do not bin)}
}
\value{
a ggplot
}
\description{
Creates a plot summarising the ordering of feature acquisitions in a list of fitted HyperTraPS
models. Segment k at ordering i for feature j gives the probability that feature j is
acquired at order i in an evolutionary process starting with no features and proceeding
to all features, from model fit k. For example, P = 0.2 at i = 3, j = 2 means there is a 0.2 
probability that feature 2 is the third to be acquired.
}
\details{
Effectively, the plot makes "bubbles" out of a collection of segments, one for each different 
inference run, so the (dis)agreement between runs can be visualised.
