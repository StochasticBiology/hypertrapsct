\title{Bubble plot for acquisition ordering}
\usage{
plotHypercube.bubbles(my.post, reorder = FALSE, transpose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{my.post}{a model fit returned from HyperTraPS}

\item{reorder}{logical, whether to reorder features by their mean ordering; default FALSE}

\item{transpose}{logical, whether to transpose the axes of the plot; default FALSE}
}
\value{
a ggplot object
}
\description{
Creates a plot summarising the ordering of feature acquisitions in a fitted HyperTraPS
model. The circle at ordering i for feature j gives the probability that feature j is
acquired at order i in an evolutionary process starting with no features and proceeding
to all features. For example, P = 0.2 at i = 3, j = 2 means there is a 0.2 probability that
feature 2 is the third to be acquired.
